// A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.
// Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.

function sumPrimes(num) {
    let currentNum = num;
    if (num == 2) { return 2 };
    for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) { currentNum = 0 }
    }
    num--;
    return currentNum + sumPrimes(num);
}

console.log(sumPrimes(10));
